    "This portion of the notebook contains a summary description of the MPC environmental dataset used in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### gridMET\n",
    "gridMET is a dataset of daily high-spatial resolution (~4-km, 1/24th degree) surface meteorological data covering the contiguous US from 1979-yesterday provided and maintained by the Climatology Lab out of UC Merced. The Climatology Lab generates the data from interpolating gridded climate data from PRISM (https://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/) and regional reanalysis from NLDAS-2 (https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/NLDAS2forcing.php). The data is available through the Microsoft Planetary computer API and as a netCDF from the lab’s website. Microlimates on the scale os < 4km^2 and wind data on the scale of <32 km^2 are below the resolution threshold and will be difficult to analyse using this data set.\n",
    "### MODIS Snow Cover 8-day\n",
    "The MODIS Snow Cover 8-day dataset was created by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (a part of CIRES at the University of Colorado Boulder). The dataset provides global coverage with spatial resolution of snow cover extent observed over an eight-day period within 10degx10deg MODIS sinusoidal grid tiles. Tiles are generated by compositing 500 m observations from the ‘MODIS Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 500m Grid’ data set. Snow Cover data ranges from 02/18/2000 to present. The file format use to store the data is GeoTIFF (COG). We will access the data using Microsoft Planetary Computer which is a similar API to Google Earth Engine. There are no known issues with data quality that may affect our results.\n",
    "### MODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire 8-Day\n",
    "The MODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire 8-Day dataset was created by NASA LP DAAC at the USGS EROS Center (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod14a2v061/) and Microsoft’s Planetary Computer (https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/modis-14A2-061).\n",
    "This datasets expands from 02/18/2000 - Present and contains Global data  on thermal anomalies/fires at a 1 km spatial resolution. The file format use to store the data is GeoTIFF (COG) and HDF. We will access the data using Microsoft Planetary Computer which is a similar API to Google Earth Engine. There are no known issues with data quality that may affect our results.\n"

    " - Assemble all of the data needed in your Github repo: Jupyter notebooks, a README file, and any datasets needed (these should be small, if included within the repo). Larger datasets should be stored on a separate server, and access codes included within the Jupyter notebook as discussed above. \n",
    " \n",
    " - Create an _environment_ file: this is a text file which contains information on the packages needed in order to execute your code. The filename should be \"environment.yml\": an example that you can use for the proper syntax is included in this template repo. To determine which packages to include, you'll probably want to start by displaying the packages loaded in your environment: you can use the command `conda list -n [environment_name]` to get a list.\n",
